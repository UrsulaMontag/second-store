# SecondStore
**IN DEVELOPMENT**
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2 (updated to version 16.2.12).

## About
This project serves as a platform for me to dive further into the world of Angular.   
 Initially, I developed a small e-commerce shop with the help of [**Slobodan Gajic's** online tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-webshop-with-angular-node-js-typescript-stripe/) on creating a web shop with Angular, Node.js, TypeScript, Tailwind and Stripe. The tutorial helped me to create the structure and content of the shop.   
  It is important to me that the shop is fully responsive on all devices and has an intuitive and accessible interface.   
Subsequently, I would like to improve the handling of the data state with NGRX and store the user interaction in a local store.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
